## Project Overview

Built a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines the power of vector-based document retrieval with local language model inference. This system enables fast, privacy-preserving conversational AI that can answer questions based on custom knowledge bases.

## Key Features

- **Local Processing**: All inference happens locally using Ollama with Llama3.2
- **Vector Search**: Efficient document retrieval using Faiss vector database
- **Context-Aware**: Generates responses based on relevant document context
- **Privacy-Focused**: No data leaves your local environment
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new documents to the knowledge base

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Document Processing**: LangChain for document chunking and embedding generation
- **Vector Storage**: Faiss for high-performance similarity search
- **Language Model**: Ollama with Llama3.2 for local inference
- **API Layer**: REST API for easy integration

### Technologies Used
- **LangChain**: Orchestration and document processing
- **Faiss**: Vector similarity search
- **Ollama**: Local LLM inference
- **Python**: Core implementation
- **REST APIs**: External integrations

## Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for most queries
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ relevance in retrieved documents
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for consumer hardware
- **Scalability**: Handles 10,000+ documents efficiently

## Use Cases

- Internal knowledge bases
- Customer support automation
- Research assistants
- Document Q&A systems
- Educational platforms

## Key Learnings

1. **Vector Quality Matters**: Proper document chunking and embedding selection significantly impact retrieval quality
2. **Context Window Management**: Balancing context length with model capabilities is crucial
3. **Local vs Cloud**: Local inference provides better privacy but requires careful resource management
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Well-crafted prompts improve response quality and consistency

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-modal support (images, tables)
- Conversation memory
- Advanced filtering and metadata search
- Integration with more LLM providers
- Performance optimization for larger datasets
