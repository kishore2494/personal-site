Like many in the tech sphere, I’ve been captivated by the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models. While interacting with a single LLM is fascinating, the true power, I believe, lies in enabling **multiple AIs to collaborate, compete, and interact autonomously**.

This belief led me to build something ambitious: a fully autonomous, **local-only AI Debating Society** — a system where agents can engage in structured debates, grounded in real knowledge, without ever calling the cloud.

In [**Part 1**](https://medium.com/ai-simplified-in-plain-english/building-an-uncensored-multi-agent-ai-debate-system-locally-with-ollama-a-guide-with-full-code-359c7b85bd68), I built a minimal debate system using Ollama.

In [**Part 2**](https://medium.com/ai-simplified-in-plain-english/building-an-uncensored-multi-agent-ai-debate-system-locally-with-ollama-a-guide-with-full-code-359c7b85bd68), I introduced a **local RAG pipeline** using LangChain, ChromaDB, and Ollama.

Now in **Part 3**, the system gets a major upgrade:

- A complete **Streamlit-based User Interface** for better usability.
- Strong **backend/frontend separation**.
- Threading to support **real-time interactions** without UI freezing.
- UI panels for agents, judge, history, and real-time updates.

Let me take you through this final stage of the build — from backend modularity to frontend interactivity.

# **Phase 1: Laying the Foundational Bricks — The Core Architecture**

Every robust system starts with clean modular design. I split the system into multiple Python files for clarity and flexibility:

- `config.py`: Central settings for everything — debate topics, LLM models, agent types, RAG parameters, prompts, and more.
- `debate_state.py`: Tracks debate history, stage, and stores all interactions in a clean data structure.
- `rag_pipeline.py`: Manages document ingestion, chunking, embedding, and similarity search using ChromaDB.
- `agents.py`: Contains the logic for all AI agents — their roles, prompt handling, RAG integration, and interaction rules.
- `app.py`: The **Streamlit frontend** with state handling, UI rendering, and backend triggering via buttons and session state.

`config.py` (The Project’s DNA):

```
# config.py

# --- Debate Configuration ---
DEBATE_TOPIC = "Should autonomous vehicles be implemented on a large scale within the next decade?"
NUMBER_OF_REBUTTAL_ROUNDS = 2 # Number of times each side gets to respond after opening statements

# Using dolphin-phi:latest for debate agents and summarization
DEFAULT_MODEL = 'dolphin-phi:latest'
SUMMARY_MODEL = DEFAULT_MODEL

# Path where the ChromaDB vector store will be saved/loaded
VECTOR_STORE_PATH = "./chroma_db"
# Ollama model to use for creating embeddings (e.g., nomic-embed-text)
EMBEDDING_MODEL = 'nomic-embed-text'
# Chunk size and overlap for splitting documents
CHUNK_SIZE = 500
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 50
# Flag to indicate if RAG should be enabled
ENABLE_RAG = True
RETRIEVER_K = 3 # Number of relevant documents to retrieve for RAG

# **Phase 2: Giving Agents a Voice — Connecting to Local LLMs**

Using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), I ran LLMs like `llama3`, `mistral`, and `gemma` locally. The agents communicate by sending structured prompts and receiving text responses.

The base `Agent` class handles all model calls. This abstraction allowed roles like `AffirmativeAgent`, `NegativeAgent`, and `JudgeAgent` to inherit behavior and customize it based on role and stage.

A major lesson: **don’t mix UI logic with backend processing**. This means no Streamlit calls outside `app.py`. The agent logic is clean, pure Python, which keeps it portable and testable.

# **Phase 3: Mastering the Art of Argumentation — Taming LLM Behavior**

Debate agents initially responded with verbose, repetitive, and sometimes vague arguments.

# **Here’s how I addressed that:**

- **Token Limit Control**: Using `num_predict` to limit output length.
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Examples were provided in prompts to guide structure.
- **Context Summarization**: Instead of passing full history, I created a `_generate_summary()` function in the orchestrator to condense all previous arguments into a short, focused context.

This not only made the responses more concise and structured but also helped each agent remain on-topic across multiple turns.

`config.py` (Prompt Examples, Limits, Summarization):

# **Phase 4: Grounding Arguments in Knowledge — The RAG Pipeline**

To make the debates fact-based, I integrated a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline using LangChain and ChromaDB.

# **Here’s the RAG flow:**

1. **Load PDFs** using `PyPDFLoader`.
2. **Split text** with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3. **Embed** using `nomic-embed-text` (locally with Ollama).
4. **Store in ChromaDB** (disk-persisted).
5. **Retrieve relevant chunks** based on query context (topic, stance, stage).
6. **Inject into prompts** before the agent generates its argument.

The agents now speak not only with structure but also with **evidence**.

# **Phase 5: Bringing It All to Life — The Streamlit UI**

Now the fun part — watching the debate unfold *live* in the browser.

# **Streamlit UI Features:**

- **Sidebar**: Choose topic, round count, and enable/disable RAG.
- **Agent Display**: Circular images, names, role badges, and dynamic status.
- **Judge Display**: Centered and updated with verdict after final round.
- **Chat History Panel**: Arguments rendered as messages in a chat-like UI.

# **Left Sidebar:**

- Set topic
- Choose number of rounds
- Toggle RAG
- Select models

# **Center Panel:**

- Visual display of agents (with circular photos and South Indian names 😉)
- Status: “Thinking”, “Speaking”, etc.
- Role icons and styling

# **Right Panel:**

- Chat history view of debate, formatted like a messaging app
- Judge comments, summaries, and final verdicts clearly shown

# **Key Challenges:**

- **Blocking Calls**: LLM calls froze the UI.✅ Solved using `ThreadPoolExecutor` to run agents in background.
- **Real-time Feel**: Instead of printing entire debate at once, I used a generator from the orchestrator and yielded one event per round.✅ This gave it a *step-by-step feel*, with each agent “thinking” and “speaking” in turn.
- **Custom Styling**: Injected CSS for chat bubbles, layout structure, and spacing.

# **Conclusion: A Society in Action and Lessons Learned**

Building this Autonomous AI Debating System with local tools, knowledge integration, and a functional UI was both complex and rewarding.

# **Key Takeaways:**

- **Modular Codebase**: Makes large systems manageable and extensible
- **Local LLMs Are Practical**: Tools like Ollama are fast and dev-friendly
- **Prompt Engineering Matters**: Small tweaks lead to major improvements
- **RAG Unlocks Real Value**: Turning generic LLMs into domain experts
- **Concurrency Enables UX**: Threading + Streamlit = smooth frontend
- **Visuals Change Everything**: A UI makes this a tool, not just a script

This project now feels like a real platform — something I can demo, improve, and even expand into more advanced multi-agent simulations.

# **Try It Out**

All code is fully open-source and modular. You can clone the repo, run it locally, and modify everything — from the agents’ personalities to how they access knowledge.

# **What’s Next?**

I’m considering adding:

- **Voice synthesis + recognition** for speaking agents.
- **Web-based user debate** (human vs. AI).
- **Agent memory tuning** across multiple debates.

Until then, feel free to explore the full system. All code is open-source and works entirely **offline**.

If you’re interested in building intelligent systems that think *together* instead of alone — this is a great playground to start.
