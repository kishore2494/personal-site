Have you ever thought about what time really is? We feel it moving, from the past, through the present, and into the future. It feels like a river flowing in one direction.

But what if I told you that's just how it *feels*? What if, in reality, **all time exists all the time?** every second of your life, your first cry, your last laugh, and every sandwich in between.

I know that sounds weird. It goes against everything we know. But to understand it, we have to forget what our common sense tells us for a moment. We have to listen to the math and the physics, which tell a much stranger and more amazing story.

## The Universe is a Single, Frozen Frame

To understand this, we need a new picture in our minds. The great physicist Einstein talked about the universe as like a single, four-dimensional "block." Let's imagine that block. (That block is called "space time").

Think of the entire universe. Everything. Every star, every planet, every person, every single thing, everywhere. Now, imagine all of it frozen in a single moment. Like someone pressed the ultimate pause button.

This is one "frame" of reality. Just like a single, still picture on a strip of movie film.

## The Movie of Reality

We all know how movies work. A movie is shot on film. Every second of that movie is made of 24 individual, frozen pictures (called frames). When these pictures flash in front of our eyes very quickly, our brain sees movement. But the movement isn't really *in* the film. The film is just a stack of still images.

Now, imagine that reality works the same way.

But the "frames" of our universe change incredibly fast. You know how there is a smallest possible size (a Planck length)? Well, there is also the smallest possible moment, a "frame" of time. Scientists call this the "Planck time".

How fast is it? It is **10 to the 44 times** shorter than a single second. One second holds **10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (that is a ten with forty-four zeros)** of these slices. That is an almost impossible number to imagine. It is to one second what one second is to trillions of times the age of the entire universe.

So, reality is like a movie with an unimaginable number of frames, each one a slightly different version of the entire universe.

And here is the most important part: **All of these frames exist at once.** They are all real. The "you" reading this sentence, the "you" on your first day of school, and the "you" of many years from now all exist, frozen in their own frames, right now.

## The Really Weird Part: Which Way Does Time Go?

This is where it gets truly strange.

In our daily lives, we are sure that the past causes the future. You drop a glass (past), so it shatters (future). That feels obvious.

But look at our "block" of all reality, where every moment exists forever. Why is one side the "past" and one side the "future"? Who decided that time should go left to right? Why can't it go right to left?

If you take away the labels "past" and "future," the block just is. All moments are equally real.

So, what if influence doesn't just go one way? What if the future also influences the past?

Think of it like an endless feedback loop. A snake eating its own tail.

Picture a long row of dominoes. We usually say the first domino knocks the second, and so on. But inside the block the dominoes are already down. The first domino may lean on the last, and the last may lean on the first.

> (Beginning is the end, the end is the beginning)

This creates a loop:

Frame 1 talks to Frame 100.

Frame 100 answers back to Frame 1.

Around and around they go, like two mirrors facing each other.

Because every frame is always there, every frame can affect every other frame, all the time.

Which part of the past is talking to which part of the future?

The answer is: **All of it.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1102/0*eTze2bBRCcqmfa2U.png)

Every single moment is connected to every other moment. The entire "network" of time is constantly shaping itself. The choices you think you will make in the future might be subtly influencing the person you are right now.

Pull back and look at the whole block again. You no longer see a line. You see a net. Each knot in the net is one moment. Strings run in every direction, tying every knot to every other knot.

Your fifth birthday is tied to the birth of a star that will shine two billion years from now. The words you will speak tomorrow are tied to the rain that fell yesterday. All moments lean on all moments, forever.

This is what it means when we say all time exists all the time. It's not just a line. It's a vast, beautiful, and complex web where every point touches every other point.

From the inside, life feels like a song playing note by note. But the sheet music is already printed. The song is not being written; it is being read.

We ride the song like a train on rails. We think we choose the turns, yet every turn was already laid. We call the rails behind us "past" and the rails ahead "future," but the whole track is fixed in one block of steel.

**A Short List of Big Examples**

- A baby born today shares a moment with the last breath of a star that died long ago.
- The phone in your pocket holds metal made in the first stars; those stars' deaths are part of today's call.
- The idea you will have next week already sits in the block, waiting for you to reach it.

Each link looks small, yet the web is huge.

We do not move through time the way a boat moves through water.

We are inside one still picture that holds every picture.

And in that one great picture, all time touches all time, all the time.

This whole thing is called the block universe theory, also known as the tenseless theory of time.

The feeling that we are moving through time is just our consciousness, like a tiny flashlight, shining on one single frame at a time. But the entire movie, from the beginning to the end, is already complete. And it is playing forever.
