In this article, I'll walk you through building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines the power of vector-based retrieval with local language models for privacy-preserving AI applications.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique that enhances language models by providing them with relevant context from external knowledge sources. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents and use them as context for generating more accurate and informed responses.

## Architecture Overview

Our RAG system consists of three main components:

1. **Document Processing**: Converting documents into embeddings
2. **Vector Storage**: Using Faiss for efficient similarity search
3. **Generation**: Using Ollama with Llama3.2 for local inference

## Implementation

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

```python
import langchain
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
import ollama
```

### 2. Document Processing

```python
def process_documents(documents):
    # Split documents into chunks
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=1000,
        chunk_overlap=200
    )
    
    chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    
    # Create embeddings
    embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
        model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    )
    
    # Create vector store
    vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
    
    return vectorstore
```

### 3. Retrieval and Generation

```python
def query_rag_system(vectorstore, query, model="llama3.2"):
    # Retrieve relevant documents
    docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=4)
    
    # Prepare context
    context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
    
    # Generate response using Ollama
    response = ollama.chat(
        model=model,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": f"Use the following context to answer the question:\n{context}"
            },
            {
                "role": "user", 
                "content": query
            }
        ]
    )
    
    return response['message']['content']
```

## Key Benefits

- **Privacy**: All processing happens locally with Ollama
- **Speed**: Faiss provides fast similarity search
- **Accuracy**: Context-aware responses improve quality
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new documents to the knowledge base

## Use Cases

This RAG system is perfect for:
- Internal knowledge bases
- Customer support chatbots
- Research assistants
- Document Q&A systems

## Next Steps

In future posts, I'll cover advanced techniques like:
- Fine-tuning embeddings for specific domains
- Implementing conversation memory
- Adding metadata filtering
- Performance optimization strategies
