![AI Home Server Setup](/personal-site/images/article%20images/Bringing%20AI%20Home%20Setting%20Up%20and%20Hosting%20Your%20AI%20Server%20Locally%20for%20Complete%20Control%20and%20Privacy/AI%20Home%20Server%20Setup.webp)

## Introduction

Have you ever wished you could have complete control over your AI models and data? With the power to run AI processes locally, you can finally achieve that level of autonomy. In this blog, we will explore how to set up and host your AI server locally, allowing for customizable models and private processing. Let's dive in and discover the world of local AI hosting.

## Setting Up a Local AI Server

Imagine having your own AI server, complete with a user-friendly GUI and advanced features, all hosted on your local machine. This capability offers unprecedented control over your AI models and the ability to impose restrictions on specific users. In collaboration with Ollama.ai, we will guide you through the process of setting up your local AI server, requiring nothing more than a computer with Windows, Mac, or Linux. For optimal performance, a GPU can be utilized to enhance processing power.

## Installing and Configuring Ollama.ai

We will walk you through the seamless installation process of Ollama.ai on Linux in a single command, as well as integrating it with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for Windows users. Furthermore, we will explore running Linux on Windows with Ubuntu 22.04, along with the installation and updating of packages. Additionally, we will promote IT Pro as a valuable learning resource for Linux and IT skills, providing a comprehensive guide for the installation process.

## Integrating AI Models Using Ollama Locally

Learn how to integrate AI models using Ollama locally and test the setup by accessing localhost and port 11434. We'll demonstrate adding and running an AI model (Llama 2) without an internet connection, providing greater privacy and control over your AI processes.

## Deploying Open Web UI Using Docker

Discover the process of installing Open Web UI, the optimal web interface for Ollama, within a Docker container. We'll guide you through updating repositories, obtaining Docker's GPG key, and executing a single command to install Docker and deploy the Open Web UI container. This approach ensures a seamless and powerful user interface for your locally hosted AI.

## Enabling GPU and Multimodal Models Locally

Uncover the benefits of leveraging GPU for local AI processing and explore the integration of multimodal models, allowing for an enhanced user experience. We will also delve into the administration of user access and permissions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of locally hosted AI.

## Creating and Customizing AI Models Locally

Take a deep dive into the world of AI model customization and control, exploring various models and system prompts. This section will guide you through the process of setting up stable diffusion locally with Automatic 1111 UI, along with the installation of dependencies and Python 3.10. Utilizing the curl command and configuring the bash RC file will be crucial steps in this journey, culminating in the installation of Python 3.10 and Automatic 1.1.1.1.

## Real-Time AI Processing

Experience the speed and power of AI processing in real-time with the capability to download and run various models on your hardware. We will also introduce new features in local AI integration, including image generation based on prompts and the integration of a local GPT model into the notes application for enhanced functionality.

## Privacy and Control with Local AI Hosting

Emphasizing the importance of privacy and control, this section showcases the advantages of running AI processes locally. With access to a chat bot for quick generation of content, this approach provides unparalleled privacy and authority over personal data. We'll demonstrate how hosting AI locally ensures sensitive information remains secure and within your control.

## Conclusion

By taking the plunge into hosting your AI locally, you can unlock a world of possibilities while maintaining complete control over your data and model customization. The ability to run AI processes in real-time, integrate new features, and ensure privacy provides an unparalleled experience. Embrace the power of local AI hosting and revolutionize the way you interact with artificial intelligence.

## Quick Guide: Build Your Own Local AI Server to Run AI Models Privately

This blog post is inspired by a YouTube video by NetworkChuck, where he builds a local AI server named Terry to run AI models locally on his own hardware.

Running AI models on the cloud can be expensive and raises privacy concerns. By building your own AI server, you can gain more control over your data and how it's used.

Here's a quick guide to get you started on building your own local AI server based on the video:

1. **Choose a Computer**: Any computer you have lying around will work, although a beefier machine will make the AI models run faster.
2. **Install Ollama**: Ollama is the foundation for running AI models locally. Download it from the Ollama website.
3. **Install Additional Software (Optional)**: If you have a GPU, you might need to install additional Nvidia CUDA drivers.
4. **Set Up the Ollama Admin Panel**: This allows you to control who can access the AI server and what models they can use.
5. **Create Model Files**: Model files are used to restrict access to specific AI models on the server.
6. **Install Automatic1111**: This lets you use stable diffusion to generate images with your AI server.
7. **Add Documents to Open Web UI**: This lets you process documents using AI models on your server.
8. **Install the Obsidian Chatbot Plugin**: This lets you chat with an AI model directly in your Obsidian notes application.

Building your own AI server is a great way to experiment with AI and keep your data private. However, it does require some technical knowledge.
