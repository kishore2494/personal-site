Adam Cheyer, a renowned AI pioneer and co-founder of Siri, offers a compelling perspective on the evolution of Artificial Intelligence, arguing that **the next ten years will not be about AI achieving super intelligence, but rather about its transformation from "knowing" to "doing"**. Drawing on nearly 40 years of experience in the field, Cheyer shares insights from AI's early days to the present, revealing his profound surprise at the unexpected leap brought by generative AI and outlining a future where AI becomes a critical tool for collective human action.

## The Genesis of AI: Understanding Words and Taking Action

Back in **2007, amidst the advent of the iPhone, the predominant AI tool was the search engine**. Cheyer and his team at Siri envisioned something more profound: a conversational assistant that could not only understand spoken words but also take action. Their goal was deceptively simple: to get computers to understand human language.

This was a monumental challenge. As Cheyer illustrates, a seemingly straightforward command like "book a four-star restaurant in Boston" is riddled with ambiguity. "Book" could refer to a reservation or a physical object; "Star" and "Boston" are names of cities, with multiple "Bostons" across the U.S.. The complexity of combining these ambiguous words made understanding "much harder than it seems". The original Siri was conceptualized as a **"do engine," capable of booking, buying, calling cabs (pre-Uber), making reservations, and purchasing tickets all through voice commands**.

## The Elusive "Common Sense" and Generative AI's Breakthrough

While the technical challenge of understanding words at scale seemed surmountable, the true "holy grail" for Cheyer was **instilling "common sense" or "world knowledge" into computers**. Humans instinctively know how to operate a computer, what a restaurant is, or how to make a reservation. Computer scientists had spent decades attempting to manually input this vast body of knowledge, but it was not scalable. Cheyer himself admitted, "I did not know how we would ever get to a system that knew as much as we did".

Then came **generative AI, which "totally surprised" and "melted" Cheyer's mind**. Despite having a clear prediction for AI's evolution over his 40-year career, the emergence of generative AI shattered his expectations, particularly regarding the common sense piece. He initially viewed generative AI as merely a "word predictor" a "super autocomplete" that operates on probabilities. However, as he experimented with it, he realized **"there's knowledge there, there's understanding"**.

What truly blew him away was the revelation that by simply trying to accurately predict the next word, generative AI unexpectedly developed a **"model of understanding for the entire world, every field, every concept, every relationship, fell out as a side effect"**. This was an unforeseen consequence, even by those working directly in the field. Cheyer describes it as **"the holy grail of AI just hopped out with no one expecting it or really conceiving of it"**.

While generative AI doesn't "feel" or experience emotions like love, **it "knows everything about love and what it means."** More profoundly, it possesses **"an expert in physics and mathematics and poetry and history and love all at once in one system," capable of making connections and reasoning across all these domains**. This profound and unexpected acquisition of knowledge was the "biggest shock of [his] entire life".

## The Next Frontier: From Knowing to Doing

Despite generative AI's incredible leap in "knowing," Cheyer points out a critical limitation: **it struggles with "doing."** He highlights the difference between an AI that can write a message and one that can actually *send* it. While ChatGPT excels at "knowing" (getting an A+ from him on that front), it cannot perform actions like sending a message, playing a song, or setting a timer, unlike Siri.

Cheyer draws a **parallel to the early internet, where static HTML pages with poor interfaces evolved into a rich, interactive web through technologies like JavaScript**. This transformation enabled not just better user experiences but also commerce and complex interactions, effectively, "doing things". He believes **AI today is akin to the internet of 1995, still in its "blink tag" HTML phase**. Language-based chat interfaces are not the optimal way to perform many tasks; for travel, for example, users prefer "photos, visuals" over discussions.

Therefore, the future evolution of AI must focus on the "doing side".

## Building an Ecosystem for Collaborative Action

A crucial missing piece for AI's progression is the **lack of an "ecosystem where everyone's needs are met"** encompassing content and service providers, and users. The current landscape is confusing, with no clear standards like "SEO for AI".

Cheyer's latest venture, **Game Planner, acquired by Airbnb, was focused on "collective decision-making and collective intelligence"**. He firmly believes that **no matter how smart AI becomes, it won't solve humanity's biggest "wicked systemic problems" like energy, hunger, poverty, war, and pollution by itself**. Humans must do the work, but AI can serve as a powerful tool to "augment our intelligence".

Game Planner aimed to **build tools to help humanity make better decisions together, combining AI, UI (user interface), and CI (collective intelligence)**. Cheyer envisions a "game plan" like "PowerPoint for decision-making" to fill a void where no dedicated tool exists for group decision-making on complex issues. This concept seeks to empower "every individual, every company, every nonprofit, every government to come together and work through the biggest problems with the help of AI".

In conclusion, **the next 10 to 25 years of AI will be characterized by its evolution into a rich "doing ecosystem," not super intelligence**. It's an age where **AI will become an invaluable collaborative tool, helping humanity to effectively tackle its most pressing global challenges**.
