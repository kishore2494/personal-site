# The Silent Grind: 4 Years in a Dark Room

Let's be real.

When you push yourself for something for more than four years, when you spend your days and nights, working 18-hour days, constantly urging yourself to achieve something quicker, you expect a change. You push your limits until they break.

But what happens when, at the end, nothing changes?

No reward. No result. No money. No business. Nothing.

Meanwhile, your friends are searching for jobs. And you? You're also searching for jobs. So, what is the difference here?

I tried for four fucking years, bro.

They were doom scrolling. Following girls. Watching movies. Going on trips. Everyone was enjoying their lives, living well.

And at the same time, you're spending your time in a dark room, silently, doing nothing but working. Like a robot.

But in the end, everybody ends up in the same place. So what was the difference? What was the point?

I saved money by sacrificing daily foods. I refused to go out with them to save money and time. I wasn't chasing women. I was focused on the goals.

I sacrificed a lot. A lot, bro.

Then what is the difference here? Nothing? Is this the result of hard work?

From age 16 to 20, I have explored and worked more than a man in his 30s or 40s. I know that. I took responsibility and did the work.

But is this the end? What the fuck?

## Then, You Get the Break.

So then, you get a job. A role no one can imagine, with a package that is good, above average.

But the thing is… this is not the end, bro.

I think I have short-term memory. If you ask someone with four years of experience a question, they will answer with the history of those four years. But I just answer with what happened in the last 3–6 months. My brain keeps changing its thought patterns over time.

So I think… this is just the beginning of something bigger.

## The First Installment.

In the end, your work, your extra time, and that resilience will pay you back. But it may take time. And it might come in installments.

In my case, getting a good package at a YC-backed startup was not the final goal. So maybe it was just the first installment.

To get more back, I need to put in more effort. I need to push myself. I need to be ruthless.

This isn't the end. It's the fuel for the next grind.
